# Exploratory Data SQL
In this phase, we will explore the dataset to identify potential trends, patterns, anomalies, and outliers.  Typically, the EDA process begins with a general hypothesis or guiding questions.

This project contains an SQL-based exploratory data analysis of the `world_layoffs` dataset.  
The analysis focuses on identifying trends and patterns in layoffs across companies, industries, and countries.

Analysis Performed
1. Basic statistics (maximum, minimum layoffs, percentages).  
2. Company-level analysis (single-day layoffs, total layoffs, 100% layoffs).  
3. Geographic analysis (by country and location).  
4. Industry and company stage analysis.  
5. Time-based analysis (yearly totals, monthly rolling totals).  
6. Ranking of top companies with the highest layoffs by year.

Tech Stack:
SQL (MySQL)
World Layoffs dataset (cleaned and staged in layoffs_staging2)
